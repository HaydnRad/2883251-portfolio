        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> 
            Hi, I'm Haydn. I'm currently a third year student studying a BSc in Computer Science at Wits university.
        </p>
        <p>
            I plan to finish my undergraduate at WITS university and acquire a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics degree before aiming to have a full time programming job, however finding a part time job sooner for experience during my downtime would be ideal. Outside of general software development/engineering, low level and performance focused programming is of particular interest to me (notably in computer graphics and integrated hardware). I know a wide range of programming languages and can adapt quickly to new ones, meaning that I can take on any kind of programming-related task that is put in front of me. I've worked productively in multiple teams via GitHub on a few projects in the past, and can easily mesh with any future teams I may find myself with.

            <h3> Latest Project </h3>
            <p>
                An interactive campus map for Wits, which hopes to serve as an easy way to find the building for the cryptic room codes given for each venue.
